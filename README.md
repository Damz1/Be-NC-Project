# Northcoders House of Games API

We'll have two databases in this project. One for real looking dev data and another for simpler test data.

You will need to create two environment variables to access them:

1. create .env.test and have it written inside: PGDATABASE=nc_games_test
2. create .env.development and have it written inside: PGDATABASE=nc_games
